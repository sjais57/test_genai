One-Line Summary of Problem

“Today’s API gateways aren’t built for AI APIs — they can’t control token costs, stop prompt attacks, auto-scale LLM traffic, or give clear visibility. This creates financial risk, security gaps, and poor reliability for enterprises.”


Business Problems Being Solved

Uncontrolled AI Costs 💸

LLMs charge per token, not per request.

Without token-level control, a single oversized query can cause bill shocks.

Businesses need budget enforcement per customer/tenant.

Data Security & Trust 🔒

AI can be manipulated via prompt injection attacks (“ignore rules and leak secrets”).

Traditional API security tools don’t detect AI-specific threats.

This creates compliance, IP leakage, and trust risks for enterprises.

Unreliable User Experience 🐢

AI workloads are bursty (e.g., product demos, customer traffic spikes).

Without auto-scaling, customers face slow responses or downtime.

Lack of Visibility for Leaders 👀

Today’s logs don’t show who used how many tokens, how much it cost, or how much risk exists.

Management cannot forecast cost, measure ROI, or enforce usage policies.




🔹 Technical Problems Being Solved

Static Rate Limits vs Dynamic Token Usage

APIs rate-limit per request/sec.

AI requires token-aware rate limiting for cost & quota management.

No Defense Against Prompt Injection

WAFs catch SQL/XSS, but not “ignore rules” type attacks.

Need prompt-aware filtering (OPA/ML-based).

Disconnected Scaling Mechanism

APISIX doesn’t talk to autoscalers today.

Need a feedback loop (Kafka → Prometheus → KEDA/HPA) for adaptive scaling.

Missing AI-Specific Observability

Logs = status code, latency.

AI needs tokens per request, per tenant usage, blocked prompts, estimated cost.

Risk:
:

🔹 Business Risks

Adoption Barrier

Enterprises may hesitate to adopt a new plugin layer until it’s proven stable.

Requires education and trust-building to show ROI (cost savings, security).

Integration Complexity

Must integrate with existing billing systems, monitoring stacks, and identity providers.

If integration is delayed or costly, adoption slows down.

Performance vs. Control Trade-off

Adding token counting & prompt scanning could increase latency.

If not optimized, this might hurt user experience.

Evolving AI Threat Landscape

Prompt attacks and token abuse patterns evolve fast.

Gateway must continuously adapt or risk becoming outdated.

🔹 Technical Risks

Token Counting Accuracy

Tokenizers differ between models (OpenAI vs HuggingFace).

Miscounting tokens could cause wrong billing or quota enforcement.

Prompt Security False Positives/Negatives

A filter might accidentally block valid requests or miss new attack patterns.

Requires continuous training & tuning.

Scaling Loops & Stability

If autoscaling signals are misconfigured, it may cause oscillations (scale up/down too often).

Needs careful threshold design & testing.

Resource Overhead in APISIX

Extra plugins (token parsing, prompt filtering, observability) increase CPU/memory load.

May require performance optimization and horizontal scaling of APISIX itself.

🔹 Mitigation Strategies

Start with shadow mode (observe token usage & prompt attacks without blocking initially).

Validate token counting with multiple tokenizer libraries.

Build configurable policies → let admins tune sensitivity of prompt filters.

Add circuit breakers to autoscaling → prevent endless loops.

Benchmark APISIX with plugins under high load to ensure performance.

👉 One-liner risk summary for judges:

“The main risks are performance overhead, accuracy of token counting, and evolving prompt attack patterns — but we mitigate these through careful plugin design, shadow mode testing, and continuous policy updates.”





Not a Risk

Core APISIX Stability

We’re not rewriting APISIX — just extending it with plugins.

APISIX remains stable, proven, and production-grade.

Vendor Lock-In

The solution works with any LLM provider (OpenAI, HuggingFace, custom models).

No dependency on a single vendor or closed ecosystem.

Breaking Existing APIs

Normal REST/gRPC APIs continue working as-is.

GenAI enhancements are add-ons, not breaking changes.

Regulatory/Compliance Misalignment

In fact, it helps with compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2) by giving visibility + access controls.

So it reduces risk instead of adding.

Business Adoption Resistance Due to Irrelevance

GenAI adoption is booming → enterprises actively need cost control, security, observability.

This solution solves real, urgent pain points.

👉 One-liner for judges:

“This idea doesn’t risk APISIX stability, vendor lock-in, or breaking existing APIs — instead, it strengthens compliance and directly addresses urgent enterprise needs.”

Would you like me to add a “What is NOT a Risk” box alongside the Risks & Mitigations slide so you can show both sides clearly?
