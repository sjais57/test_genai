Option 1 – Business-Oriented (for Senior Managers & Judges from Non-Tech Backgrounds)

Proposed Status:
We will build an AI-ready Gateway that acts like a guardian + cost manager + traffic controller for AI APIs.

Guardian → Stops harmful or manipulative prompts before they reach the AI.

Cost Manager → Tracks AI usage in words/tokens to keep customers within budget.

Traffic Controller → Automatically expands or shrinks servers to handle demand smoothly.

Dashboard → Clear insights into usage, cost, and risks in plain language.

✅ Best for management, investors, or judges who value clarity and outcomes over technical detail.

🔹 Option 2 – Balanced (Semi-Technical + Business)

Proposed Status:
We will extend APISIX Gateway with adaptive intelligence to handle Generative AI traffic.

Token-Aware Control: Enforce per-customer usage limits at the token level, preventing unexpected billing spikes.

Prompt Protection: Detect and block malicious prompt patterns (like “ignore your rules”), reducing data leakage risks.

Autoscaling: Connect gateway metrics with autoscaling tools so inference servers scale automatically.

AI Observability: Provide dashboards showing tokens consumed, latency, errors, and costs per tenant.

✅ Best for audiences that include some technical judges but also managers.

🔹 Option 3 – Technical (for Expert Judges or Engineers)

Proposed Status:
We propose a Generative AI Gateway Layer on top of APISIX with new pluggable modules:

Token-Aware Rate Limiter → Counts input/output tokens per request, enforces tenant budgets.

Prompt Security Filter → Inline OPA/Rego or ML-based detection for prompt injections.

Adaptive Autoscaling Loop → Kafka + Prometheus metrics trigger KEDA/HPA for scaling inference pods.

Observability Exporter → Structured metrics for Grafana dashboards (tokens, latency, costs, blocked prompts).
